<br>

**byi**: i do not play ponytown with the intent to create well-acquainted and lasting friendships, so do not expect this from me. i rarely interact with people outside of my party, and on the off-chance that i do, be aware that i **often go afk without warning**, i am **typically off-tab**, and i will usually adjust to your behaviour *unless you are weird.* i **don't like nor need tone tags** and i am not fond of oversharing about myself. i am very skeptical and judgemental, so i apologise for my hesitance to believe certain things<br>

**dni**: overly sexual, immature, or selfish people. if you **joke about wars**, fake mental illnesses, or **disrespect religion**. people that romanticise criminals / are obsessed with true crime, e.g. **zero day**. if you are born in 2010 and later **iwc**, i do not like interacting with young people. it's advisable that **narcissistic people** and **systems** *(unless we already know each other)* do not interact with me; this is mainly for your sake as i am likely to doubt you or feel threatened/uncomfortable by you. i understand your disorder is out of your power but if i suspect/discover you are faking **i will hate you**. what you do mocks the struggle of real systems and only brings more backlash.
