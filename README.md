**byi**: i do not play ponytown with the intent to create well-acquainted and lasting friendships, so do not expect this from me. i rarely interact with people outside of my party, and on the off-chance that i do, be aware that i **often go afk without warning**, i am **typically off-tab**, and i will usually adjust to your behaviour *unless you are weird.* i **don't like nor need tone tags** and i am not too fond of sharing things about myself.<br>

**dni**: overly sexual, immature, or selfish people. if you **joke about wars**, fake mental illnesses, or **disrespect religion**. people that romanticise criminals / are obsessed with true crime, e.g. **zero day**. if you are born in 2010 and later **iwc**, i do not like interacting with young people.
